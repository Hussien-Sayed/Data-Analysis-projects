I used Loan Data From Prosper Dataset.


### The main findings of the exploratory analysis are:
1. the loan amount distribution looks skewed to the right with a peak around 5000$.
2. the log-scaled distribution of number of investors is a left skewed distribution 
having a peak around 70 investors while the original distribution has a long tail at 
the first few values.
3. people with an income range above 50,000$ tend more to have loans around 15,000$ 
than other income ranges.a long tail exists in the 100,000$+ income range which means 
that these include the highest loan amounts .people with income range (1-25,000$) 
have the highes amount of loans below 5000$.
4. the current loans have relatively less number of investors more monthly income 
and more loan amount.
5. high loan amount values have long term duration. 100,000$+ income range have the 
longest term duration at the highest loan amount.
6. a medium number of investors for each income range has the longest term ratio
 while at maximum number of investors we have a medium term duration.
