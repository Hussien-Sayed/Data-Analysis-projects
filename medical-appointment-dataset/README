In this project I explore "The Medical Appointment No Shows" Dataset which contains information about some patients' medical appointments like :
The IDs of the patient and the appointment.
The gendre and age of the patient.
The scheduled date and the appointment day.
Some characteristics and problems of the patients like their Scholarship(social welfare program) and weither or not they have Hypertension,Diabetes and Alcoholism and the number of Handicaps they have if any.
Weither the patient recived an SMS or not.
The location of the hospital.
Weither the patient showed to the appointment or not.

In this project I explore the dataset to find an answer to the following questions:
-Is there a relation between the age or the gendre of the patient and him showing to the appointment?
-Does any of the characteristics and problems of the patients like Hypertension affect showing to the appointment? Does receiving an sms matter?
-Does the delay between the appointment and the schedule day and the weekday of the appointment affect showing to the appointment?
